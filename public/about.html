<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Whatâ€™s up, Iâ€™m George ðŸ‘‹ â€” a former analyst who fell in love with web development and building cool stuff online. 
Iâ€™ve always had a creative side, and coding turned out to be the perfect mix of logic and imagination for me. 
I played both football and lacrosse in college, so Iâ€™m all about teamwork, challenges, and staying active.
Outside of tech, Iâ€™m big into photography, anime, and podcasting. I love playing pickleball, working out, gaming,
and grabbing a Guinness with friends. This site is my place to share everything 
Iâ€™m learning and creating on my journey to becoming a web developer.</p>
